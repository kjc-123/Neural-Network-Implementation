# Neural-Network-Implementation
Simple neural network with one hidden layer training on MNIST

Done out of my personal curiosity

warning - very scuffed; issues include:
 - dimensions of everything are backwards from what is standard
 - only implemented one (1) hidden layer with sixteen (16) neurons; code is not very generalizable in present state
 - many files with useless/broken tests

Special thanks goes to 3blue1brown for his series on Neural Networks, which is how I initially learned everything, and Michael Nielsen, whose neural network implementation I referenced.
